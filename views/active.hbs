    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>
      <p>Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir.</p>

      <p>Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo. You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you.</p>
      <p>You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy. I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.
